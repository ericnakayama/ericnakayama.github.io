	 This is my website that explains everything about HTML.  HTML, or HyperText Markup Language can be used to created a lot of web pages containing the amount of codes in the correct syntax.  You can have tons of ways to create a lot of websites on the Internet using codes that make it work on your computer.  It also includes other computer languages.  You can create web files and folders in order to make it easy for Web browsers to read and use it to create a content of the page.  You can use opening and closing tags that make the code clear.

HTML shows you how the structure of a website will look like, which makes it a markup language instead of a programming language.

	  HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images and other material into visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS.

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, who was a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the first browser and server software in late 1990.</p>
	  <p>The first description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML.</p>
